-            <ul>

-              <li>Now making use of Toasts for any in-app notifications.</li>
-              <li>Utilized GtkBuilder UI definitions to describe nearly all interface objects and eliminate lots of boilerplate code.</li>

-            <ul>
-              <li>Added support for multiple search terms by separating them using a "⎵" (space) or "+" (plus) to find only results matching both terms and by using a "," (comma) to find results matching either term.</li>
-              <li>Now displays a message if there are no results found instead of showing an empty network list.</li>
-            </ul>

-            </ul>

           <li>Implemented XdpPortal to request permission to run in the background and to set background status when doing so.</li>
